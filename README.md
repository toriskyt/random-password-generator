When the user visits the password generator page they are able to click on the Generator Password button to begin generating a password.

A series of questions will be asked with each click as to how the user would like their password to look.  The questions ask the user whether to include or excluse certain criteria.

The password criteria include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, special characters, the length of the password (The password must be between 8 and 128 characters.  Any choice lower than 8 or higher than 128 will result in an error message.)

When the user has completed the criteria, the random password will automatically appear in the box.
